## Dynamic Honeypot Orchestrator with Web Dashboard

This project introduces the Honeypot Orchestrator, a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the entire honeypot lifecycle[cite: 2]. It allows users to easily configure and deploy various honeypot types (SSH, Web) as Docker containers, automatically aggregates attack data, provides real-time monitoring, and offers intuitive data visualization[cite: 3, 4].

### Features

* **Simplified Deployment and Management:** Easily deploy and remove common honeypot services (SSH, Web) via a graphical interface, abstracting Docker complexities[cite: 14].
* **Centralized Monitoring and Data Aggregation:** Automatically collect attack logs from all deployed honeypots into a single, persistent store[cite: 15].
* **Enhanced Testing Capabilities:** Offer sophisticated attack simulation features with adjustable complexity and types to validate honeypot effectiveness and security posture[cite: 16].
* **AI-Driven Insights:** Integrate with Google's Gemini AI to provide automated analysis of attack patterns and actionable security recommendations[cite: 5, 17].
* **Intuitive Web-Based Management:** Manage honeypots (create, view, delete) and simplify Docker deployment for standard honeypots with state recovery[cite: 24].
* **Automated Threat Collection:** Ensure data integrity with automated threat collection and deduplication[cite: 25].
* **Real-time Visibility:** Gain real-time visibility through comprehensive dashboards, timelines, and statistical breakdowns[cite: 25].
* **Realistic Testing Environment:** Simulate diverse network attacks (Login Brute-Force, SQLi, XSS, Port Scan, DoS, etc.) with adjustable complexity[cite: 27].
* **Intelligent Insights:** Get intelligent insights via automated pattern analysis and tailored security recommendations through integrated Google Gemini AI[cite: 28].

### Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python with the FastAPI framework, interacting with Docker via `docker-py`[cite: 20]. Data is stored in JSON files[cite: 21]. Google Gemini API is used for AI features[cite: 21].
* **Frontend:** TypeScript with the Next.js/React framework for the user interface[cite: 22]. Tailwind CSS is used for styling[cite: 22]. Chart.js enables data visualization, and Lucide React provides iconography[cite: 23].
* **Core Concepts:** Asynchronous programming, RESTful API design, containerization (Docker)[cite: 23].

### Architecture

The project is built upon a decoupled Client-Server architecture[cite: 38].

* **Backend:** Developed using Python and FastAPI, serving as the central control plane and data processing engine[cite: 39]. It exposes a RESTful API for management and data retrieval, manages honeypot configurations, orchestrates Docker container lifecycles, persists application state using file-based JSON storage, interacts with the Google Gemini API, and manages connections for real-time attack data[cite: 40, 41]. Background tasks handle periodic operations like synchronizing attack logs[cite: 42].
* **Frontend:** A modern web application built with Next.js and React (TypeScript), providing the graphical user interface[cite: 43]. It interacts with the backend exclusively through the defined REST API for fetching data and initiating actions[cite: 44]. It also maintains a connection to the backend for near real-time attack information display[cite: 45].
